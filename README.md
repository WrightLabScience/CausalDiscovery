# Causal Discovery tools using causal-cmd

This repository contains scripts (mostly R and bash) to run causal discovery algorithms in Tetrad on the command line (causal-cmd: [GitHub](https://github.com/bd2kccd/causal-cmd) and [Documentation](https://bd2kccd.github.io/docs/causal-cmd/)).

See `run_tetrad_example.sh` for an example use.

I am using tetrad to perform a causal search over datasets derived from electronic health record data. Some of the R scripts found in this repository are specific to my data but contain useful code for parsing tetrad output.
